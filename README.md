# Personal-Portfolio-Website
- A personal portfolio website is a digital space to showcase your skills, projects, experience, and other relevant details. It's essential for professionals and students alike to make a great first impression on potential employers, clients, or collaborators. Building the code for a portfolio website can involve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and sometimes a back-end framework if you need dynamic content or user interactions.
-HTML Structure
The HTML code organizes the portfolio content and includes metadata for search engines.

# HTML Header:

* The <head> tag includes essential metadata, the title of the page, and a link to an external CSS file cssFile.css.
* Metadata for character encoding, viewport settings (for responsiveness), and a description for search engines is included.

2. Body Content:

- Header Section: Uses the header tag to display the site’s title and user role details. Here, it’s a welcome message with "Web Developer | Web Designer | Programmer" under the name.

- About Section: Introduced with a container section id="about", this section briefly describes the portfolio owner’s background and skills.

- Skills Section: The skills list is shown within section id="skills" using a flexbox-style list, with each skill placed in an HTML li element inside a ul tag and given the card class.

- Projects Section: This section lists past projects, each with a title and description, using a section id="experience" tag. It also has individual div id="skills" elements for each project description.

- Experience Section: Similar to Projects, it highlights work experience with job titles, company names, and brief descriptions of responsibilities.

- Contact Section: Contains a message and an email link for visitors to contact the owner.

- Footer Section: The footer contains copyright text.

# CSS Styling
* The styling enhances the look of each section and controls layout.

1. Basic Styles:

* body: Sets line-height for overall readability.
* header: Styled with a dark background color, white text, and padding for spacing. Centered text makes it a strong visual anchor.
* .container: Sets maximum width and center alignment to make sections responsive on various devices.
* h2: Styles headers in each section with a bottom border, top margin, and a gray text color.

2. Skill Cards & Flexbox:

* .skills, .projects, .experience, .contact: Defined as flexible containers (display: flex;) with flex-wrap: wrap;, allowing elements to wrap onto new lines if necessary, making it more responsive.
* .card: Each skill and experience card is given background and border colors, padding for spacing, and rounded corners, making the text stand out against the background.

3. Footer:

* Styled with a dark background, white text, and centered alignment for a balanced look at the end of the page.

# How It Works
- HTML and CSS Link: HTML provides the structure, and CSS in the external file (or embedded styles here) formats it visually.
- Responsive Layouts: Flexbox properties in .skills and .projects allow for flexible layouts, meaning that on smaller screens, the cards will stack or wrap, ensuring readability.
- Interactive Features: Email and LinkedIn links are added for interactivity, allowing users to click and directly contact the owner.

==> This structure and styling create a clean, professional portfolio that’s easy to navigate and adaptable across device sizes. The content organization and styling give visitors an easy, visually appealing way to learn about the user’s background, skills, and achievements.
